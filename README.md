# Fragment Ensemble Scoring (FRESCO)

This repo contains code describing [Fragment Ensemble Scoring (FRESCO)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.21.517375v1), a method for hit-finding from a fragment screen. FRESCO uses unsupervised machine learning to model a distribution of pharmacophore combinations in 3D space, which is then used to conduct a virtual screen on the EnamineREAL library for discovery of moelcular hits. This method is unique in directly predicting hit compounds from a fragment screen without any assaying of binding activity required, and has demonstrated success computationally on a retrospective analysis of COVID Moonshot compounds as well as in prospectively discovering hit compounds for both SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and SARS-CoV-2 nsp3-Mac1.

The repo contains all of the code necessary for fitting a model on fragment screen data and scoring molecules, but not the EnamineREAL datadue to storage limitations.

# Usage

## Installation

Functions for utilising FRESCO can be used as a python library by importing the `fresco` module via `pip install .*` in the root directory of the repo, which should only take several seconds.

The conda environment used for generating the results in the paper can be recreated by running `conda env create -f environment.yml` in the root directory of the repo.

## Example

The demo notebook `demo.ipynb` contains a short example of how to train FRESCO on fragment-protein complexes, and use it to score a molecule.
