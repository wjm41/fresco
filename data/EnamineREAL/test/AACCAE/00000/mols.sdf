    The ligand was originally not a salt, therefore no desalting was carried out.
    The tautomeric state was generated by cxcalc version 18.20.0 of ChemAxons JChem Suite.
    Protonation state was generated at pH 7.4 by cxcalc version 18.20.0 of ChemAxons JChem Suite.
    Generation of the 3D conformation was carried out by molconvert version 18.20.0 of ChemAxons JChem Suite.
    Generation of the the target format file (pdbqt) was carried out by Open Babel version 2.4.1.

    The ligand was originally not a salt, therefore no desalting was carried out.
    The tautomeric state was generated by cxcalc version 18.20.0 of ChemAxons JChem Suite.
    Protonation state was generated at pH 7.4 by cxcalc version 18.20.0 of ChemAxons JChem Suite.
    Generation of the 3D conformation was carried out by molconvert version 18.20.0 of ChemAxons JChem Suite.
    Generation of the the target format file (pdbqt) was carried out by Open Babel version 2.4.1.

    The ligand was originally not a salt, therefore no desalting was carried out.
    The tautomeric state was generated by cxcalc version 18.20.0 of ChemAxons JChem Suite.
    Protonation state was generated at pH 7.4 by cxcalc version 18.20.0 of ChemAxons JChem Suite.
    Generation of the 3D conformation was carried out by molconvert version 18.20.0 of ChemAxons JChem Suite.
    Generation of the the target format file (pdbqt) was carried out by Open Babel version 2.4.1.

    The ligand was originally not a salt, therefore no desalting was carried out.
    The tautomeric state was generated by cxcalc version 18.20.0 of ChemAxons JChem Suite.
    Protonation state was generated at pH 7.4 by cxcalc version 18.20.0 of ChemAxons JChem Suite.
    Generation of the 3D conformation was carried out by molconvert version 18.20.0 of ChemAxons JChem Suite.
    Generation of the the target format file (pdbqt) was carried out by Open Babel version 2.4.1.

    The ligand was originally not a salt, therefore no desalting was carried out.
    The tautomeric state was generated by cxcalc version 18.20.0 of ChemAxons JChem Suite.
    Protonation state was generated at pH 7.4 by cxcalc version 18.20.0 of ChemAxons JChem Suite.
    Generation of the 3D conformation was carried out by molconvert version 18.20.0 of ChemAxons JChem Suite.
    Generation of the the target format file (pdbqt) was carried out by Open Babel version 2.4.1.

    The ligand was originally not a salt, therefore no desalting was carried out.
    The tautomeric state was generated by cxcalc version 18.20.0 of ChemAxons JChem Suite.
    Protonation state was generated at pH 7.4 by cxcalc version 18.20.0 of ChemAxons JChem Suite.
    Generation of the 3D conformation was carried out by molconvert version 18.20.0 of ChemAxons JChem Suite.
    Generation of the the target format file (pdbqt) was carried out by Open Babel version 2.4.1.

    The ligand was originally not a salt, therefore no desalting was carried out.
    The tautomeric state was generated by cxcalc version 18.20.0 of ChemAxons JChem Suite.
    Protonation state was generated at pH 7.4 by cxcalc version 18.20.0 of ChemAxons JChem Suite.
    Generation of the 3D conformation was carried out by molconvert version 18.20.0 of ChemAxons JChem Suite.
    Generation of the the target format file (pdbqt) was carried out by Open Babel version 2.4.1.

    The ligand was originally not a salt, therefore no desalting was carried out.
    The tautomeric state was generated by cxcalc version 18.20.0 of ChemAxons JChem Suite.
    Protonation state was generated at pH 7.4 by cxcalc version 18.20.0 of ChemAxons JChem Suite.
    Generation of the 3D conformation was carried out by molconvert version 18.20.0 of ChemAxons JChem Suite.
    Generation of the the target format file (pdbqt) was carried out by Open Babel version 2.4.1.

    The ligand was originally not a salt, therefore no desalting was carried out.
    The tautomeric state was generated by cxcalc version 18.20.0 of ChemAxons JChem Suite.
    Protonation state was generated at pH 7.4 by cxcalc version 18.20.0 of ChemAxons JChem Suite.
    Generation of the 3D conformation was carried out by molconvert version 18.20.0 of ChemAxons JChem Suite.
    Generation of the the target format file (pdbqt) was carried out by Open Babel version 2.4.1.

    The ligand was originally not a salt, therefore no desalting was carried out.
    The tautomeric state was generated by cxcalc version 18.20.0 of ChemAxons JChem Suite.
    Protonation state was generated at pH 7.4 by cxcalc version 18.20.0 of ChemAxons JChem Suite.
    Generation of the 3D conformation was carried out by molconvert version 18.20.0 of ChemAxons JChem Suite.
    Generation of the the target format file (pdbqt) was carried out by Open Babel version 2.4.1.

    The tautomeric state was generated by cxcalc version 18.20.0 of ChemAxons JChem Suite.
    Protonation state was generated at pH 7.4 by cxcalc version 18.20.0 of ChemAxons JChem Suite.
    Generation of the 3D conformation was carried out by molconvert version 18.20.0 of ChemAxons JChem Suite.
    Generation of the the target format file (pdbqt) was carried out by Open Babel version 2.4.1.
